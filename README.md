# What is KBF.

KBF stands for **Keyboard Fun**, this website wants to give the user *a guide to the mechanical keyboards I recommend* and also aims to *showcase my keyboard portfolio*.

# The idea behind KBF.

KBF wants to show to the world all **the Mechanical Keyboards that I (***David Carmona***) have made**, also, **provide a guide of which Keyboards I would recommend**.

I also want the website to include tools like a **Keyboard tester**, a **contact page** or a **modifications guide**.

# Download this website!

This website is nowadays ***Open Source***! That means you can download it and run into your Desktop using *Next.js* and try whatever you want on your own!

With this decision, I want to **provide users with complete transparency in what my Website does**, also, there is a chance that *I learn something from users who modify my code*.

# Tecnologies.

This website is developed in **Next.js**, using **Tailwind** and **CSS** for styling and **Typescript** as an alternative for JS.

Using **LDRS** for animated loaders!

I also use **Hostinger** for the website's domain and **Firebase** for hosting.

Running the backend on **Google Cloud** and using **Sendgrid** to make the contact form and the SQL API works.

# Visit my website!

You can [visit my website here](https://davidca.es/)! For now, the domain is ***davidca.es***, but it *will change in some point of the development*.

# What Am I developing right now?

Now, I'm focushing on ***"My work"*** part, developing the API for the SQL connections, and working both, the *Frontend* and *Backend*, by now, I'm working on the **Keyboard web-page**, will be followed by the **implementation of all Keyboards**, then, will do **animations for the carrousel** and finally **add some navigation utilities** on it.
