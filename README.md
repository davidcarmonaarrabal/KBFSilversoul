# What is KBF.

KBF stands for **Keyboard Fun**, this website wants to give the user *a guide to the mechanical keyboards I recommend* and also aims to *showcase my keyboard portfolio*.

# The idea behind KBF.

KBF wants to show to the world all **the Mechanical Keyboards that I (***David Carmona***) have made**, also, **provide a guide of which Keyboards I would recommend**.

I also want the website to include tools like a **Keyboard tester**, a **contact page** or a **modifications guide**.

# Download this website!

This website is nowadays ***Open Source***! That means you can download it and run into your Desktop using *Next.js* and try whatever you want on your own!

With this decision, I want to **provide users with complete transparency in what my Website does**, also, there is a chance that *I learn something from users who modify my code*.

# Tecnologies.

This website is developed in **Next.js**, using **Tailwind** and **CSS** for styling and **Typescript** as an alternative for JS.

I also use **Hostinger** for the website's domain and **Firebase** for hosting.

# Visit my website!

You can [visit my website here](https://davidca.es/)! For now, the domain is ***davidca.es***, but it *will change in some point of the development*.
